# AvLoop — things that bite

The standing rules for traps found while building AvLoop. Each entry: the trap, what it does, the rule. Newest at the
end of its section.

## Build and tools

- **PowerShell 5.1 takes a native tool's stderr for an error** when `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` (vcvars64,
  cmake, windeployqt all write notes to stderr). Rule: native calls go through `Invoke-Native` in `scripts/build.ps1`
  (local `Continue`, the exit code decides). (AV-001)
- **vcvars64.bat looks for `vswhere.exe` on PATH and complains**; harmless, but it must be silenced (`>nul 2>&1`)
  inside `cmd /c`. (AV-001)
- **A `.ico` cannot be made by Qt's image writer with several sizes.** Rule: `tools/icons/iconbake.cpp` renders the
  SVG and writes a PNG-entry `.ico` itself; `resources/app/avloop.ico` is committed and checked by `check-icons.mjs`;
  the `.rc` is added only when the `.ico` exists (a fresh configure after it appears). (AV-001)
- **A GUI-subsystem exe started from PowerShell without a pipe is not waited for.** Rule: walks run the app from Node
  (`spawnSync`), or pipe its output. (AV-001)

## Qt

- **A `QToolButton`'s own shortcut animates a click** (100 ms) before the button toggles; a walk's next step reads the
  old tool. Rule: tool keys are window `QAction`s that call `selectTool` at once. (AV-001)
- **A token written in a QSS comment is a token**: the theme's expansion leaves `@name` in a comment unresolved and the
  test fails. Rule: QSS comments never contain an at-sign. (AV-001)
- **`QMenu::exec` runs its own event loop**: a walk that presses the ☰ button blocks inside the press. Rule: the next
  menu press is armed by a timer *before* the button is pressed (`WalkRunner::stepMenu`). (AV-001)
- **Thin strokes at 20 px have no fully opaque pixel**: a 1.75-unit line at 20/24 scale covers two pixel rows at ~73%.
  Rule: tests that check an icon is drawn look for alpha above 100, not 200. (AV-001)
